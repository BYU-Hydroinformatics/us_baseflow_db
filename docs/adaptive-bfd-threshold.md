# Magnitude-Adaptive BFD Threshold

How the BFD ensemble decides whether a separation method calls a given day
baseflow-dominant, and why that decision is no longer a single fixed number.

Implemented in [`bfd_db/labeling/ensemble.py`](../src/bfd_db/labeling/ensemble.py)
(`anchor_flows`, `effective_threshold`, `label_from_ratio`), configured via
[`PipelineConfig`](../src/bfd_db/config.py). Consumed by the national database
build ([`bfd_db/database/build.py`](../src/bfd_db/database/build.py)) and by
`low_flow_analyst`'s live BFD ensemble panel, which is this algorithm's
downstream consumer, not a second implementation of it.

---

## 1. Summary

Each ratio-based voter used to label a day BFD when

```
qb_method / Q  >=  0.95
```

with `0.95` fixed for every day of every gage. That test is now **ramped by flow
magnitude**: strict at high flow, relaxed at low flow, log-interpolated between
two anchors taken from the gage's own flow duration curve.

The ramp is **opt-in**. `PipelineConfig().bf_ratio_threshold_low` defaults to
`None`, which makes `effective_threshold()` return the flat `bf_ratio_threshold`
for every day — bit-for-bit the pre-ramp behavior. This is deliberate: the
national database build must not change its labels out from under a frozen
snapshot just because this module gained a capability. A caller opts in by
setting `bf_ratio_threshold_low` explicitly (e.g. `0.75`).

Nothing about the underlying separation changes — `separate_baseflow()` and
`run_pybfs_separation()` are untouched. The threshold is applied after the fact
in `label_gage_all_methods()`, so it is cheap to recompute for many parameter
choices without rerunning any filter or PyBFS.

---

## 2. The problem it solves

The fixed `0.95` test was not merely strict — for most voters it was
**unreachable**. Every digital filter plateaus at its own ceiling of `qb/Q` well
below 1.0, because `BFI_max`-style parameters structurally cap the baseflow
fraction the method can report.

Median `qb/Q` by flow band, gage 03198350:

| Flow band | Eckhardt | Chapman | Lyne-Hollick | Boughton | PyBFS |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Lowest 5% | 0.867 | 0.752 | 0.903 | 0.760 | 0.590 |
| P5–P20 | 0.875 | 0.755 | 0.855 | 0.763 | 0.629 |
| P20–P50 | 0.857 | 0.730 | 0.734 | 0.738 | 0.636 |
| Highest 10% | 0.383 | 0.271 | 0.348 | 0.285 | 0.327 |

Two things to read out of this:

1. **The filters respond correctly in direction.** The ratio climbs steeply as
   flow falls — Eckhardt goes 0.383 at storm flow to 0.867 at the lowest flows.
   The signal is there.
2. **They plateau, and the plateau is method-specific and below 0.95.** Eckhardt
   tops out near 0.87, Chapman near 0.75, PyBFS near 0.60, and they stay flat
   across the entire lower half of the record. No amount of "more baseflow-like"
   pushes them to 0.95.

So on a flat, low, obviously baseflow-dominant recession, most voters still
failed the test. In the lowest 5% of flows only 31% of days passed for Eckhardt
and 7% for PyBFS. The threshold was above the ceiling of the instrument.

## 3. The algorithm

### 3.1 The ramp

For each day with flow `Q`:

```
s(Q)      = clip( (ln Q − ln q_lo) / (ln q_hi − ln q_lo), 0, 1 )
t_eff(Q)  = t_lo + (t_hi − t_lo) · s(Q)
```

where

- `t_hi` = `bf_ratio_threshold` — the threshold at and above the high anchor
- `t_lo` = `bf_ratio_threshold_low` — the threshold at and below the low anchor
- `q_lo`, `q_hi` = the two anchor flows in cfs (§3.2)

`s` is clipped, so the curve is flat outside the anchors: every day at or above
`q_hi` gets exactly `t_hi`, every day at or below `q_lo` gets exactly `t_lo`.

**Interpolation is on log flow, not linear flow.** Streamflow is log-distributed
— on these gages the median spans 0.61 to 6,710 cfs across sites and three orders
of magnitude within a single site. A linear ramp would spend nearly all its range
on storm flows and collapse the entire low-flow region into the first pixel.

### 3.2 The anchors

Both anchors are **quantiles of the gage's own non-zero flow**, not absolute cfs:

```python
q_pos = q.replace(0, np.nan)
q_lo  = q_pos.quantile(low_flow_anchor)    # default 0.10
q_hi  = q_pos.quantile(high_flow_anchor)   # default 0.50
```

Anchoring on the gage's own flow duration curve is what lets a single setting
travel across a network of gages with wildly different magnitudes. An absolute
cutoff ("relax below 50 cfs") is meaningless on a river whose median is 6,710 cfs
and on one whose median is 0.61 cfs.

> **Naming convention — read this carefully.** These are percentiles of the flow
> *distribution* (non-exceedance), so `low_flow_anchor = 0.10` is the **10th
> percentile of flow**, which in the usual hydrologic convention is **Q90** — the
> flow exceeded 90% of the time. Any UI built on this (e.g. `low_flow_analyst`'s
> panel) should label them `P10` / `P50` and print the resolved cfs, precisely so
> this convention never has to be guessed at.

Zeros are excluded before taking quantiles, so an intermittent record's
zero-flow days do not drag the low anchor to 0 and flatten the ramp.

### 3.3 Worked example

Gage 03198350, defaults `t_hi = 0.95`, `t_lo = 0.75`, `P10/P50`
→ `q_lo = 9.96 cfs`, `q_hi = 46.50 cfs`:

| Q (cfs) | s | t_eff | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5.00 | 0.000 | 0.7500 | below low anchor — clipped |
| 9.96 | 0.000 | 0.7500 | at low anchor |
| 30.10 | 0.718 | 0.8935 | mid-ramp |
| 46.50 | 1.000 | 0.9500 | at high anchor |
| 500.00 | 1.000 | 0.9500 | above high anchor — clipped |

---

## 4. The ratio clamp

`label_from_ratio()` clamps the ratio at 1.0 before comparing it to the
threshold:

```python
ratio = (q_b / q.replace(0, np.nan)).clip(upper=1.0)
```

Separated baseflow exceeding total flow is unphysical but does occur, PyBFS
especially. Frequency of `qb_pybfs > Q`:

| Gage | Days affected | Median overshoot | Max |
|---|---|---|---|
| 03198350 | 4.5% | 1.11× | 3.1× |
| 13077000 | 30.1% | 1.39× | 81.1× |
| 10263000 | 24.5% | 1.85× | 46.7× |
| 10263500 | 8.9% | 1.14× | 3.3× |

The rule adopted is **any day whose separated baseflow meets or exceeds total
flow counts as fully baseflow-dominant**.

**This clamp does not change any label.** A ratio above 1.0 already passed every
threshold ≤ 1.0, so the vote is identical with and without it — verified: PyBFS
holds at 6.5% BFD on 03198350 either way. What it buys is that an 81× value is
no longer carried around as a number, so the behaviour is explicit rather than
incidental, and stays correct if a threshold of exactly 1.0 is ever used.

It is **not** a fix for the underlying problem. See §8.

## 5. Edge cases

| Condition | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `bf_ratio_threshold_low is None` | ramp off, flat `bf_ratio_threshold` — the `PipelineConfig()` default |
| `bf_ratio_threshold_low > bf_ratio_threshold` | clamped down to `bf_ratio_threshold` — the ramp flattens rather than inverting |
| `low_flow_anchor` / `high_flow_anchor` outside [0, 1] | clipped to [0, 1] |
| `high_flow_anchor <= low_flow_anchor` | `q_hi <= q_lo`, no usable ramp → flat `bf_ratio_threshold` for every day |
| Near-constant or all-zero record | quantiles collapse, `q_hi > q_lo > 0` fails → flat `bf_ratio_threshold` |
| Non-finite anchor flows | flat `bf_ratio_threshold` |
| `Q = 0` on a day | `t_eff` filled with `bf_ratio_threshold`; ratio is NaN, comparison is False, day labels **not BFD** |
| `qb` is NaN (filter warm-up, non-converged PyBFS) | comparison False → **not BFD** |

Every fallback lands on the *strict* flat threshold, so a misconfiguration
under-labels rather than silently over-labels.

## 6. Config surface

All parameters live on `PipelineConfig` ([`bfd_db/config.py`](../src/bfd_db/config.py)):

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `bf_ratio_threshold` | `0.95` | `t_hi`, threshold at/above the high anchor |
| `bf_ratio_threshold_low` | `None` | `t_lo`; `None` = ramp off (flat threshold) |
| `low_flow_anchor` | `0.10` | low anchor, as a flow quantile |
| `high_flow_anchor` | `0.50` | high anchor, as a flow quantile |
| `voting_fraction` | `0.5` | fraction of voters needed for an ensemble BFD |
| `t_c` | `3` | event pooling gap tolerance, days |
| `d_min` | `7` | event pooling minimum duration, days |

`label_gage_all_methods(site_no, q, config, rf_model, rf_scaler)` is the single
entry point that runs all method families and applies whichever threshold
`config` specifies. Downstream fields useful for reporting:

| Function | Returns |
|---|---|
| `effective_threshold(q, ...)` | `t_eff` per day, same index as `q` |
| `anchor_flows(q, ...)` | `(q_lo, q_hi)` in cfs |
| `voter_agreement_stats(labels, ensemble)` | per-voter `bfd_fraction` and `agreement` with the ensemble |

---

## 7. Results

Defaults `0.95 / 0.75` at `P10/P50`, versus the old flat `0.95`:

| Gage | Anchor flows (cfs) | BFD flat → adaptive | Events flat → adaptive |
|---|---|---|---|
| 03198350 | 9.96 → 46.5 | 17.7% → **29.3%** | 132 → 179 |
| 13077000 | 434 → 6,710 | 17.8% → **26.5%** | 335 → 333 |
| 13181000 | 106 → 221 | 21.0% → **41.4%** | 284 → 421 |

The check that matters is the storm end, which must **not** move. On 03198350 the
highest-decile BFD rate is 0.3% before and 0.3% after; on 13077000, 2.0% and
2.0%. The relaxation buys low-flow sensitivity without letting storm days leak
in.

---

## 8. Known limitations

**PyBFS is an unconditional vote at low flow on some gages.** The clamp makes
`qb > Q` days count as BFD, but on 13077000 that is 30.1% of the record, sitting
at median flow-duration position 0.206 — the lower fifth of the flow range,
exactly where discrimination matters. On those days PyBFS is not voting on
evidence. The worst cases are sudden collapses in observed flow (52–82 cfs on a
river with a 6,710 cfs median, clustered in October and mid-January) that a
smooth recession model cannot follow — plausibly diversion shutoff or
ice-affected gauging. This is a separation/calibration problem, not a threshold
problem, and remains open. Note the overshoot is *not* a unit error: ratios run
1.0–81× with a median of 1.39×, whereas a cfs↔m³/s slip would be a constant
35.31×.

**No flatness or recession criterion.** The ramp keys on flow *magnitude* only.
A small storm peak occurring during a low-flow period gets the relaxed threshold
purely because the flow is low. Adding a slope gate — relax only when
`|d ln Q/dt|` is small and the flow is not rising — was considered and
deliberately deferred; it is the natural next refinement if false BFD days show
up on minor low-flow events.

**RF-BFD is unaffected by any of this.** It is a classifier that emits 0/1 labels
directly and never sees a ratio or a threshold. Its column is passed through
untouched, which is why its BFD fraction is identical before and after the
change, and why the ramp never moves it.

---

## 9. Choosing anchors

The defaults are not universal. What matters is the **spread** between the two
anchor flows, and that varies a lot by gage:

| Gage | P10 → P50 | Spread |
|---|---|---|
| 03198350 | 9.96 → 46.5 cfs | 4.7× |
| 13181000 | 106 → 221 cfs | 2.1× |

A compressed spread means the ramp does almost nothing: on 13181000, a flat
recession sitting at ~150–200 cfs is already near the *top* of a 106→221 ramp and
gets a near-strict threshold, which is exactly the failure the ramp was built to
fix. Widening the anchors resolves it:

| Anchors | Anchor flows (cfs) | BFD | Events |
|---|---|---|---|
| P10/P50 (default) | 106 → 221 | 41.4% | 421 |
| P25/P75 | 149 → 700 | 61.1% | 406 |
| P40/P90 | 187 → 2,320 | 66.4% | 408 |
| P2/P20 | 71 → 136 | 27.5% | 324 |

**Rule of thumb:** check what the anchor flows resolve to first. If the two
anchor flows are within a factor of ~3, the ramp is too tight to do useful work —
widen the high anchor. Regulated rivers and snowmelt-dominated gages tend to have
compressed low-flow duration curves and want wider anchors than the default.

print(flat["ensemble"].mean(), adaptive["ensemble"].mean())

# the threshold curve and anchors on their own
t = effective_threshold(q, 0.95, 0.75, 0.10, 0.50)
print(anchor_flows(q, 0.10, 0.50), t.min(), t.max())
```

The plateau table in §2 comes from binning `qb_method / Q` by
`Q.rank(pct=True)` and taking the median per band.
